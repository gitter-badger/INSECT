## INSECT is the INcosiderate SEntence CaTcher

INSECT can be used by all websites to **eliminate** bad language, racial comments, gendered comments and generally insensitive comments.

Syntax: `insect-tool <string> -s`
		`insect-tool <filename> -f`

This can also help people do more considerate writing and make the world a better place.

And that's exactly what INSECT aims to do.
