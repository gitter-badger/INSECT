# INSECT
## INSECT is the INcosiderate SEntence CaTcher

INSECT can be used by all websites to **eliminate** bad language, racial comments, gender favouring and generally insensitive comments.

Syntax: `insect-tool  -s <string>`
		`insect-tool -f <filename>`

This can also help people do more considerate writing and make the world a better place.

> “Leave the world in better conditions in which you found it.” 
― Baden Powell

And that's what INSECT aims to do.
